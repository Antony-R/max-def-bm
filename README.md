# max-def-bm
I made a single page application which calculates the maximum deflection and bending moment of a beam using predifined formulas.<br>
I used angular to build this simple single page application.<br>
All the calculations are based on metric system.<br>
There is also a mm to m converter which is built by using custom pipes in angular.<br>
